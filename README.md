# Shopping Cart App

This project is about working with React Router alongside TDD.

## Technologies used

React, HTML, CSS, JS, Jest

## Learning Process

TDD, whilst initially difficult, is actually fun and can almost gamify coding. However, learning how to access all the different components on a page got very tedious and really slowed down my production as I had to basically learn this alongside writing the code for the project.

React Router seems like an easy to use and strong router option. Whilst I am used to express and doing routes in there, I can see the functionality benefits of having it all on the client-side ready to go.

I wanted to get the bare bones of a working cart before styling anything. I went for a class heavy approach this time and did find that quite a bit more challenging than normal. Usually styling is very natural and comes quite quickly at the end of the process, but with the multiple components to keep track of, the process was that little bit longer.

Ultimately, I have a firm grasp on useState, useEffect, Router and some very basic testing principles for React apps, however another few more projects written where I force myself to TDD is still needed at this point.

On reflection, I chose food because it's the obvious choice, however I want to change this and incorporate pictures too. I will hopefully continue to develop this project further.
